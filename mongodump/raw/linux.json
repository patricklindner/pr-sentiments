It looks for `SPDX-License-Identifier:` followed by 0 or more of any characters except new lines, followed by `GPL-{digit}.{digit}+`.

Previously it used the\r\nvma retirement of the context object to keep itself pinned until the\r\nnext request (after i915_vma_move_to_active()). In the conversion, I\r\nmissed that the vma retirement was also responsible for marking the\r\nobject as dirty. Mark the context object as dirty when pinning\r\n(equivalent to execlists) which ensures that if the context is swapped\r\nout due to mempressure or suspend/hibernation, when it is loaded back in\r\nit does so with the previous state (and not all zero).\r\n\r\nFixes: e8a9c58fcd9a (\"drm/i915: Unify active context tracking between legacy/execlists/guc\")\r\nReported-by: Dennis Gilmore <dennis@ausil.us>\r\nReported-by: Mathieu Marquer <mathieu.marquer@gmail.com>\r\nBugzilla: https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=99993\r\nBugzilla: https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=100181\r\nSigned-off-by: Chris Wilson <chris@chris-wilson.co.uk>\r\nCc: Tvrtko Ursulin <tvrtko.ursulin@intel.com>\r\nCc: <drm-intel-fixes@lists.freedesktop.org> # v4.11-rc1\r\nLink: http://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/msgid/20170322205930.12762-1-chris@chris-wilson.co.uk\r\nReviewed-by: Tvrtko Ursulin <tvrtko.ursulin@intel.com>\r\n(cherry picked from commit 5d4bac5503fcc67dd7999571e243cee49371aef7)\r\nSigned-off-by: Jani Nikula <jani.nikula@intel.com>\r\n\r\n* netfilter: invoke synchronize_rcu after set the _hook_ to NULL\r\n\r\nOtherwise, another CPU may access the invalid pointer.

Depend\r\non such obscure assumptions is not a good idea.\r\n\r\nLast, in nfnetlink_cttimeout, we use kfree_rcu to free the time object,\r\nso in cttimeout_exit, invoking rcu_barrier() is not necessary at all,\r\nremove it too.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Liping Zhang <zlpnobody@gmail.com>\r\nSigned-off-by: Pablo Neira Ayuso <pablo@netfilter.org>\r\n\r\n* netfilter: nfnl_cthelper: fix a race when walk the nf_ct_helper_hash table\r\n\r\nThe nf_ct_helper_hash table is protected by nf_ct_helper_mutex, while\r\nnfct_helper operation is protected by nfnl_lock(NFNL_SUBSYS_CTHELPER).\r\nSo it's possible that one CPU is walking the nf_ct_helper_hash for\r\ncthelper add/get/del, another cpu is doing nf_conntrack_helpers_unregister\r\nat the same time. This is dangrous, and may cause use after free error.\r\n\r\nNote, delete operation will flush all cthelpers added via nfnetlink, so\r\nusing rcu to do protect is not easy.\r\n\r\nNow introduce a dummy list to record all the cthelpers added via\r\nnfnetlink, then we can walk the dummy list instead of walking the\r\nnf_ct_helper_hash. Also, keep nfnl_cthelper_dump_table unchanged, it\r\nmay be invoked without nfnl_lock(NFNL_SUBSYS_CTHELPER) held.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Liping Zhang <zlpnobody@gmail.com>\r\nSigned-off-by: Pablo Neira Ayuso <pablo@netfilter.org>\r\n\r\n* netfilter: nf_ct_ext: fix possible panic after nf_ct_extend_unregister\r\n\r\nIf one cpu is doing nf_ct_extend_unregister while another cpu is doing\r\n__nf_ct_ext_add_length, then we may hit BUG_ON(t == NULL). Moreover,\r\nthere's no synchronize_rcu invocation after set nf_ct_ext_types[id] to\r\nNULL, so it's possible that we may access invalid pointer.\r\n\r\nBut actually, most of the ct extends are built-in, so the problem listed\r\nabove will not happen. However, there are two exceptions: NF_CT_EXT_NAT\r\nand NF_CT_EXT_SYNPROXY.\r\n\r\nFor _EXT_NAT, the panic will not happen, since adding the nat extend and\r\nunregistering the nat extend are located in the same file(nf_nat_core.c),\r\nthis means that after the nat module is removed, we cannot add the nat\r\nextend too.\r\n\r\nFor _EXT_SYNPROXY, synproxy extend may be added by init_conntrack, while\r\nsynproxy extend unregister will be done by synproxy_core_exit. So after\r\nnf_synproxy_core.ko is removed, we may still try to add the synproxy\r\nextend, then kernel panic may happen.\r\n\r\nI know it's very hard to reproduce this issue, but I can play a tricky\r\ngame to make it happen very easily :)\r\n\r\nStep 1. Enable SYNPROXY for tcp dport 1234 at FORWARD hook:\r\n  # iptables -I FORWARD -p tcp --dport 1234 -j SYNPROXY\r\nStep 2. Queue the syn packet to the userspace at raw table OUTPUT hook.\r\n        Also note, in the userspace we only add a 20s' delay, then\r\n        reinject the syn packet to the kernel:\r\n  # iptables -t raw -I OUTPUT -p tcp --syn -j NFQUEUE --queue-num 1\r\nStep 3. Using \"nc 2.2.2.2 1234\" to connect the server.\r\nStep 4. Now remove the nf_synproxy_core.ko quickly:\r\n  # iptables -F FORWARD\r\n  # rmmod ipt_SYNPROXY\r\n  # rmmod nf_synproxy_core\r\nStep 5. After 20s' delay, the syn packet is reinjected to the kernel.\r\n\r\nNow you will see the panic like this:\r\n  kernel BUG at net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_extend.c:91!\r\n  Call Trace:\r\n   ? __nf_ct_ext_add_length+0x53/0x3c0 [nf_conntrack]\r\n   init_conntrack+0x12b/0x600 [nf_conntrack]\r\n   nf_conntrack_in+0x4cc/0x580 [nf_conntrack]\r\n   ipv4_conntrack_local+0x48/0x50 [nf_conntrack_ipv4]\r\n   nf_reinject+0x104/0x270\r\n   nfqnl_recv_verdict+0x3e1/0x5f9 [nfnetlink_queue]\r\n   ? nfqnl_recv_verdict+0x5/0x5f9 [nfnetlink_queue]\r\n   ? nla_parse+0xa0/0x100\r\n   nfnetlink_rcv_msg+0x175/0x6a9 [nfnetlink]\r\n   [...]\r\n\r\nOne possible solution is to make NF_CT_EXT_SYNPROXY extend built-in, i.e.\r\nintroduce nf_conntrack_synproxy.c and only do ct extend register and\r\nunregister in it, similar to nf_conntrack_timeout.c.\r\n\r\nBut having such a obscure restriction of nf_ct_extend_unregister is not a\r\ngood idea, so we should invoke synchronize_rcu after set nf_ct_ext_types\r\nto NULL, and check the NULL pointer when do __nf_ct_ext_add_length. Then\r\nit will be easier if we add new ct extend in the future.\r\n\r\nLast, we use kfree_rcu to free nf_ct_ext, so rcu_barrier() is unnecessary\r\nanymore, remove it too.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Liping Zhang <zlpnobody@gmail.com>\r\nAcked-by: Florian Westphal <fw@strlen.de>\r\nSigned-off-by: Pablo Neira Ayuso <pablo@netfilter.org>\r\n\r\n* netfilter: nf_nat_snmp: Fix panic when snmp_trap_helper fails to register\r\n\r\nIn the commit 93557f53e1fb (\"netfilter: nf_conntrack: nf_conntrack snmp\r\nhelper\"), the snmp_helper is replaced by nf_nat_snmp_hook.

However later it is possible to update this replay_esn via a\r\nXFRM_MSG_NEWAE call.  There we again validate the size of the supplied\r\nbuffer matches the existing state and if so inject the contents.  We do\r\nnot at this point check that the replay_window is within the allocated\r\nmemory.  This leads to out-of-bounds reads and writes triggered by\r\nnetlink packets.  This leads to memory corruption and the potential for\r\npriviledge escalation.\r\n\r\nWe already attempt to validate the incoming replay information in\r\nxfrm_new_ae() via xfrm_replay_verify_len().  This confirms that the user\r\nis not trying to change the size of the replay state buffer which\r\nincludes the replay_esn.  It however does not check the replay_window\r\nremains within that buffer.

This makes proper fault\r\nhandling complicated.\r\n\r\nThis patch implements pa_memcpy() in assembler. That way we have correct fault\r\nhandling and adding a 64-bit copy routine was quite easy.\r\n\r\nRuntime tested with 32- and 64bit kernels.\r\n\r\nReported-by: Al Viro <viro@ZenIV.linux.org.uk>\r\nCc: <stable@vger.kernel.org> # v4.9+\r\nSigned-off-by: John David Anglin <dave.anglin@bell.net>\r\nSigned-off-by: Helge Deller <deller@gmx.de>\r\n\r\n* parisc: Clean up fixup routines for get_user()/put_user()\r\n\r\nAl Viro noticed that userspace accesses via get_user()/put_user() can be\r\nsimplified a lot with regard to usage of the exception handling.\r\n\r\nThis patch implements a fixup routine for get_user() and put_user() in such\r\nthat the exception handler will automatically load -EFAULT into the register\r\n%r8 (the error value) in case on a fault on userspace.  Additionally the fixup\r\nroutine will zero the target register on fault in case of a get_user() call.\r\nThe target register is extracted out of the faulting assembly instruction.\r\n\r\nThis patch brings a few benefits over the old implementation:\r\n1. Exception handling gets much cleaner, easier and smaller in size.\r\n2. Helper functions like fixup_get_user_skip_1 (all of fixup.S) can be dropped.\r\n3. No need to hardcode %r9 as target register for get_user() any longer. This\r\n   helps the compiler register allocator and thus creates less assembler\r\n   statements.\r\n4.

I believe this is a clearer message, as it describes that the process has been killed, not merely that there was an attempt. `kill -9 1` is an example of an attempt to kill init, that does not succeed. Thus, I believe changing the message to \"init was killed\" or similar helps to differentiate between attempts, and successful attempts that cause kernel panics.\r\n\r\nThe exact message may of course be amended, but I believe it is important that the successful nature of the process kill is noted, in order for better debugging.","created_at":"2017-07-24T14:47:08Z","closed_at":"2017-07-24T14:49:49Z","merged_at":null,"user_id":18362201,"sentiment":{"polarity":0.24166666666666667,"subjectivity":0.4527777777777778}}
